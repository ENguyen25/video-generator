# LUCID STREAM

## Description
A lot of our favorite videos are scattered across the Internet on different platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, and TikTok. What if we could have all the videos accessible on one single platform. Thus, we came up with the idea of LUCID STREAM, which pulls up video results from YouTube and Dailymotion on a single webpage. 

Through this project, we learned how to work as a team to create the app. We split up the work between people's strengths on CSS and JavaScript. We learned how to use the CSS framework Materialize. We also learned how to implement the YouTube Data API and the YouTube iFrame API to search for and display YouTube videos.

## Installation
The app can be accessed at this website: https://enguyen25.github.io/video-generator/ 

## Usage
1. Type in search key term in the search bar (ie. dogs, cats). Video results will pop up.
2. Click any video you want to watch. You can click new videos while the old video is playing. You can also search for a new key term on the same screen.
3. You can add comments that will be saved no matter what videos you watch.
